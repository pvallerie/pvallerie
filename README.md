### Hi I'm Pete! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Engineer who's career in tech began in a Ski and Bike Shop, continued into the world of streaming TV advertising, and is now leading me into Software Engineering. I've enjoyed working with React, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Python, Django, the MERN stack, and some other technologies - but I can't wait to learn more!

I live in Portsmouth, NH and am searching for a role at a company with the right balance of great culture, great product, and happy people.

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-vallerie/) and reach out if you're interested in talking tech, wellness, food, mountain biking, hiking, campaing, skiing, or anything outdoors!
