### Hey there,

My name is Pete and I'm a Backend Software Engineer who's career in tech began in a Ski and Bike Shop, continued into the world of streaming TV advertising, and has led me into Software Engineering. I've dabbled with a bunch of front and backend languages/frameworks/tools during my education, but spend most of my time working with JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and Express.

I'm currently living in Fort Collins, CO and work as a Software Engineer for Modo Labs.

Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-vallerie/) and reach out if you're interested in talking tech, wellness, food, mountain biking, hiking, campaing, skiing, or anything outdoors!
